# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please note that in the case of a security issue being reported, only the latest release will be fixed. Users of earlier releases of the PixelPerfect Studios web application can of course patch the version that they use and open an MR - it will be reviewed and a micro-release published.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities via the contact form at the personal website of the main project contributor: https://annexsoftworks.com/contact.html
